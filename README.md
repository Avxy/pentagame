What needs to be done:

## Board design improvement

* All sizes are now related to the size of the stop rs.

* The order of steps could be logical... 

That is: draw all white (corner, junction) plus one arc, one leg, and one arm, 
preferrably all to the left... Then numbers x,y,z hence 
names of stops be logical. Thinking forward. 
Needs to be easily read out by any other implementation - thus logica.

* The stops on the arcs need to be only arcs really. 
There are just three stops on the rim between corners.
